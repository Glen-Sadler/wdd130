        We aim to introduce and invite visitors to experience the rich and
        diverse world of iconic New Zealand cuisine. From traditional Māori
        delicacies to locally-sourced, fresh ingredients unique to Aotearoa, our

        The indigenous cuisine of Aotearoa, shaped by Māori culture, features a
        rich variety of ingredients and traditional cooking methods that honor
        the land and sea. The hāngi, an earth-cooked meal, includes meats and
        root vegetables like kūmara, while kaimoana (seafood) such as pāua,
        kina, and tītī bring unique coastal flavors to the table. Native plants
        like puha, used in hearty boil-ups, and edible seaweed like karengo add
        distinct local tastes, alongside rewena, a traditional Māori bread made
        with a fermented potato starter. These dishes reflect values of
        manaakitanga (hospitality) and kaitiakitanga (guardianship), emphasizing
        respect for natural resources. By preserving these foods, Māori culture
        sustains its identity and shares its rich culinary heritage.
